WARNING (theano.sandbox.cuda): The cuda backend is deprecated and will be removed in the next release (v0.10).  Please switch to the gpuarray backend. You can get more information about how to switch at this URL:

/home/capybara/BayesianHypernet/BHNs.py:184: UserWarning: theano.function was asked to create a function computing outputs given certain inputs, but the provided input variable at index 3 is not part of the computational graph needed to compute the outputs: learning_rate.
To make this warning into an error, you can pass the parameter on_unused_input='raise' to theano.function. To disable it completely, use on_unused_input='ignore'.
  on_unused_input='warn')
/home/capybara/BayesianHypernet/BHNs.py:90: UserWarning: The parameter 'updates' of theano.function() expects an OrderedDict, got <type 'dict'>. Using a standard dictionary here results in non-deterministic behavior. You should use an OrderedDict if you are using Python 2.7 (theano.compat.OrderedDict for older python), or use a list of (shared, update) pairs. Do not just convert your dictionary to this type before the call as the conversion will still be non-deterministic.
