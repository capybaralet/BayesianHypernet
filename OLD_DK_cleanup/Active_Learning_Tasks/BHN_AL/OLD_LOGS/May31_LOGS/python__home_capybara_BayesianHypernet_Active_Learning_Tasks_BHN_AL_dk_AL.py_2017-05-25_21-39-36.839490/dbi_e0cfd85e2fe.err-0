/home/capybara/BayesianHypernet/dk_hyperCNN.py:105: UserWarning: The parameter 'updates' of theano.function() expects an OrderedDict, got <type 'dict'>. Using a standard dictionary here results in non-deterministic behavior. You should use an OrderedDict if you are using Python 2.7 (theano.compat.OrderedDict for older python), or use a list of (shared, update) pairs. Do not just convert your dictionary to this type before the call as the conversion will still be non-deterministic.
